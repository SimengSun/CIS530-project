Pagliardini, Matteo, Prakhar Gupta, and Martin Jaggi. "Unsupervised learning of sentence embeddings using compositional n-gram features." arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.02507 (2017).

This is unsupervised learning (not using true similarities in gs file) with similarities of each pair just from cosine similarity of sentence embeddings. The sentence embeddings is sent2vec.
