`en-train-gold.txt`, `en-val-gold.txt` and `en-test-gold.txt` are three files containing gold labels of training data, development data respectively.

Here we enclose two examples of predicted scores generated by two extended model (published baseline + BiLSTM trained sentence embeddings, baseline + CNN trained sentence embeddings)ï¼š`pred_en_test_cnn.txt` and `pre_en_test_lstm.txt`

Evaluation: (compare the pearson correlation between predicted scores and gold labels)

`python3 ../code/evaluate.py --goldfile ../output/en-test-gold.txt --predfile ../output/pred_en_test_cnn.txt`
