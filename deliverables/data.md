For each group of datasets, it consists of<br>
- a .txt file with pairs of sentences and<br>
- a .txt goldfile with a list of similarity by human judgements; length of list is same as number of pairs in first .txt file.


Score is scaled between 0 and 5 with six levels of similarity summarized in [1].

For monolingual and cross-lingual task, each of them has 3 pickle files.
xx.pkl: includes both training and test data of the format:

            {
                1: [list of first sentence],
                2: [list of second sentence],
                'score': [list of corresponding similarity scores] if a line doesn't
                 have score, use -1 to pad
            }
            
xx-test.pkl: contains all test pairs (evaluation data for 2017 task1)<br>
split-xx.pkl: contains 80%/20% split of training/development data
            
            {
                'train': { SAME FORMAT AS xx.pkl},
                'val':  {SAME FORMAT AS xx.pkl}
            }
