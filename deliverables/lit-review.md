- This paper introduces three methods to measure semantic textual similarity(STS), all of which rely on jaccard coefficient of information content of  the given sentence pairs. This problem can then be simplified to compute non-overlapping information content(IC) of two sentences. By adding words one by one from each layer of WordNet hierarchy taxonomy and computing information content gain iteratively, their original algorithm is improved since no searching for all subsume concepts is needed. Besides computing the similarity score using single IC feature in an unsupervised way, they also tried to combine sentence alignment and word embedding respectively as extra feature to train supervised models to improve their performance. According to their result, IC combined with word embedding achieves the best result.

6. Compi_LIG - Simeng
- **[Ferrero, Jérémy, et al. "CompiLIG at SemEval-2017 Task 1: Cross-language plagiarism detection methods for semantic textual similarity." arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.01346 (2017).](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.01346.pdf)**
- Their system combined syntax-based, dictionary-based, context-based and MT-based methods in both supervised and unsupervised way. For syntactical method, they compute cosine similarity of n-gram representation of two sentences; for dictionary-based method, two sets of words for another language can be obtained from Google Translate, then the summation of  weighted Jaccard distance of such set is used to compute the final score; for context-based method, they use weighted distributed representation of words as sentence embedding and compute cosine similarity, where the weights are computed in dictionary-based method; for MT-based approach, they use monolingual aligner to get aligned utterances and measure a variation of jaccard distance based on inverse document frequency of aligned utterances.


7. LIM_LIG - Yezheng
- **[Ferrero, Jérémy, and Didier Schwab. "LIM-LIG at SemEval-2017 Task1: Enhancing the Semantic Similarity for Arabic Sentences with Vectors Weighting." International Workshop on Semantic Evaluations (SemEval-2017). 2017.](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01531255/)**
- CBOW model is the basic idea for word embeddings, with some modification. Besides idf weights, this manuscript includes POS weights which is unique to me. 
- From word embeddings to sentence embeddings, they use sum of vectors (which is strange to me).

8. DT_Team - Yezheng
 - **[Maharjan, Nabin, et al. "DT_Team at SemEval-2017 Task 1: Semantic Similarity Using Alignments, Sentence-Level Embeddings and Gaussian Mixture Model Output." Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017). 2017.](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S17-2014)**
 - POS-tagging, name-entity recognition as well as  normalization, tokenization, lemmatization are preprocess procedure for word embeddings;
 - From word embeddings to sentence embeddings, this manuscript describes (interesting to me) word alignment; then the similarity score was computed as the sum of the scores for all aligned word-pairs divided by the total length of the given sentence pair. 


9. sent2vec - Yezheng
 - **[Pagliardini, Matteo, Prakhar Gupta, and Martin Jaggi. "Unsupervised learning of sentence embeddings using compositional n-gram features." arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.02507 (2017).](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02507)**
 - This is unsupervised learning (not using true similarities in gs file) with similarities of each pair just from cosine similarity of sentence embeddings. The sentence embeddings is sent2vec.
