Inheritance is an important feature in object orientated programming.	The peropos of inheritance in object oriented programming is to minimize the reuse of existing code without modification.	3.0
In probability theory, the prior and conditional probabilities of two random events are related by Bayes' theorem.	Bayes' Theorem is a theorem of probability theory originally stated by the Reverend Thomas Bayes.	1.0
Without a proof of correctness, such an algorithm is likely to fail.	However an object cannot be cast to a class which is no relative of it.	0.0
So in essence it is a popularity contest between WebPages.	It is essentially a popularity meter.	3.0
Several different ways of computing these values, additionally known as (term) weights, have been developed.	Several different ways have been developed of calculating these values (also known as term weights).	5.0
The other method is the top down approach which is a method that combines memorization and recursion.	Since the PageRank is the most important algorithms which is used in the Google engine.	0.0
The order in which terms appear in the document is lost in a vector space representation.	If a term occurs in the document, the value will be non-zero in the vector.	1.0
The method takes much less time than naive methods.	And thus the method takes much less time than more naive methods.	4.0
Inheritance is one of the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming.	In object oriented programming inheritance is also dependant on access level modifiers.	1.0
As a formal theorem, Bayes' theorem is valid in all common interpretations of probability.	Bayes theorem can be used to compute the probability that a proposed diagnosis is correct.	2.0
Thus, the program is the best plan for action that is produced.	After this, it is using this to pick the best overall path.	0.0
The basic idea is to represent each document as a vector of certain weighted word frequencies.	In the vector space model a document is represented as a vector.	3.0
Object oriented programming is a style of programming that supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.	Inheritance is a basic concept in object oriented programming.	3.0
The vector space model has some limitations: 1.	The limitations of the vector space model are thus.	3.0
It is mainly used to calculate the probability of one event’s outcome given that a previous event happened.	It is also called the posterior probability because it is derived from or depends upon the specified value of B.	2.0
The theorem is often used when we have observations and wish to compute posterior probabilities.	Bayes theorem can be used to compute the probability that a proposed diagnosis is correct.	3.0
This can be useful when the number of times a word appears is not considered important.	It has no relationship to computer programming; instead it is a process of finding a satisfactory algorithm.	0.0
In probability theory, Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events.	In probability theory, the prior and conditional probabilities of two random events are related by Bayes' theorem.	4.0
One of the best known schemes is tf-idf weighting (see the example below).	One of the best known schemes is tf-idf weighting, proposed by Salton, Wong and Yang.	3.0
It is therefore used to create relationships between one object and another.	It also provides a way to generalize du to the "is a" relationship between classes.	3.0
Then, using this, the best overall path can be found, thereby demonstrating the dynamic programming principle.	The further down an inheritance tree you get, the more specific the classes become.	0.0
When a document is represented as a vector, each dimension corresponds to a separate term.	A document has representation as a vector.	3.0
To achieve this, the programmer has to note generalisations and similarities about various aspects of the program.	It is similar to divide and conquer, however is differentiated as its subproblems are not independent.	0.0
The further down an inheritance tree you get, the more specific the classes become.	The differing application has a direct influence on what the definition of the term means.	0.0
The algebraic model for representing text documents and objects as vectors of identifiers is called the vector space model.	The limitations of the vector space model are thus.	2.0
In general, dynamic programming is used on optimisation problems, where the most efficient solution is needed.	However, the key in Dynamic Programming is to determine the structure of optimal solutions.	5.0
It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings.	A possible use for a vector space model is for retrieval and filtering of information.	2.0
The easiest way to look at inheritance is as an “…is a kind of” relationship.	It also provides a way to generalize du to the "is a" relationship between classes.	0.0
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	It is "prior" in the sense that it does not take into account any information about B.	0.0
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	The method can be abused when people deliberately link to sites in order to raise a site's PageRank.	0.0
